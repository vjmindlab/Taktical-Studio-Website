                The maple tree has long been associated with Canada, and it
                comes to life in the experience when layered with reimagined
                “aboriginal techno aesthetic.” The organic nature of the leaves,
                combined with the technological texture of the trunk,
                exemplifies Canada’s technological innovation in the form of a
                knowledge tree.

                The Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) is a government agency that
                assists Canadian born businesses in expanding internationally by
                connecting them with funding and support as well as programmes,
                opportunities, and a global network of trade commissioners in
                over 160 cities.

          <h2>The Ask</h2>
          <p>
            Assist in making the Government of Canada booth, at EWIT summer 2022
            edition, interactive by incorporating augmented reality (AR) and
            virtual reality (VR) experience with 3D conceptual art & animation
            to promote the Trade Commissioner Service in the Hague, thereby
            taking the first step toward a more tangible, digital and engaging
            method of showcasing Canada’s technological achievements to the rest
            of the world.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The Government of Canada, through TCS, desires to enter the
            metaverse however lacks a robust online digital presence. The Trade
            Commissioner Service's participation in EWIT 2022 was viewed as a
            stepping stone for the government's entrance into the digital age.
            In addition to the absence of previous digital precedent, the
            project faced other constraints, such as a very limited area to
            house the experience and an extremely tight delivery deadline, only
            45 days from concept to final delivery.
          </p>

        <div class="sec2img">
          <h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
          <p>
            Blender 3.1, the free and open-source software, was used to create
            and publish all 3D assets in the GLTF file format (a royalty-free
            specification for engines and apps) to efficiently transmit and load
            the 3D scenes and models into the code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Custom scripts were written in Vanilla JavaScript in order to
            further customise the experience in accordance with the concept. By
            utilising “A-Frame,” a web framework for developing 3D/AR/VR
            experiences, Taktical’s team made the experience compatible with
            Oculus Quest, Rift, WMR, SteamVR, mobile, and desktop.
