                Many sectors have been impacted by AI, and more breakthroughs
                are inevitable. However, AI is still strongly reliant on
                individuals and requires collaboration to fulfil tasks. The
                graphic narrative focuses on how AI empowers humans
                and depicts the collaboration between the two.

          <h2>The Ask</h2>
          <p>
            Even after conducting prior research on the development of a new
            certification programme for analytical models to improve the quality
            and speed of SCM decision making, the Supply Chain Canada + Alberta
            Institute reported that the number of interested parties in
            enrollment was far smaller than initially anticipated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In attempting to comprehend the issue, the marketing department
            discovered a flaw in the way the course was being presented when
            investigating the reasons for the low enrollment rate. It wasn't so
            much that the subject wasn't compelling enough, but that the
            communication, which was mainly reliant on the
            Artificial Intelligence portion of the course , became somewhat
            intimidating to the general audience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Creating a striking visual concept for a sceptical audience is a
            difficult endeavour that must be approached with caution. The key to
            success is knowing how far to go conceptually without upsetting the
            audience, and most of the time this work demands the storytelling to
            be toned down to provide a welcoming efficient beautiful look.

          <h2>Design Storytelling - The graphic narrative</h2>
          <p>
            Taktical team built a pleasant visual story that could very well
            interact with the audience in a relaxing manner by employing common
            visual signifiers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The scenes of ordinary supply chain workers, coupled with geographic
            coordinates of latitude and longitude mounted on a 3D cube in front
            of a plexus graphic image as symbol of technology are not a novel
            approach to framing the theme at hand, but it was a formula basic
            enough for represent the concept while making the audience feel
            comfortable and at ease.

            Implementing The Design Storytelling To The Enrollment Website And
            Sales Deck
          </h2>
          <p>
            The website had to be clean, concise, and simple, displaying
            technology through a few elements that didn't have to be
            necessarily triggered by the user. The  whole atmosphere of dynamism
            and automation should occur naturally in order to provide the
            illusion of artificial intelligence desired by the client without
            the user making any effort. To accomplish this, a variety of
            animations was used, ranging from background films to s.croll
            animations.
